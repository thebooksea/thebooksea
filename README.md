# Booksea


_Everything Can Become a Book._


## Overview


> Booksea is a startup with a new concept called "Social System", different from a social network, a social system has a product behind it, social networks use people who access the platform as a product. Booksea has books as a product, not people, so people can enjoy books and the sense of community that comes with that. Booksea uses a lot of open-source projects, so there is a great sense of giving back, you can expect a lot of open-source projects coming from Booksea.
